\section{Introduction}
A graph is an ordered pair $G=(V,E)$ consisting of a finite nonempty set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of edges, where each edge is an unordered pair of vertices. A dominating set of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set $D \subseteq V$ such that each vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor in $D$. A paired-dominating set is a dominating set whose induced subgraph contains at least one perfect matching \cite{lamport1}.


Raz and Safra prove that the dominating set problem has no polynomial-time $C \log|V|$-approximation algorithms better than $C\log|V|$  \cite{lamport2}.

Lin and Tu design an $O(m+n)$ time algorithm for interval graphs and an $O(m(m+n))$ time algorithm for circular-arc graphs, they solve the paired domination problem in interval graphs.\cite {lamport3}.
