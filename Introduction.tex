\section{Introduction}
A graph is an ordered pair $G=(V,E)$ consisting of a finite nonempty set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of edges, where each edge is an unordered pair of vertices. A dominating set of $G=(V,E)$ is a set $D \subseteq V$ such that each vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor in $D$. A paired-dominating set is a dominating set whose induced subgraph contains at least one perfect matching~\cite{1}.

Raz and Safra prove that the dominating set problem has no polynomial-time $(c \log|V|)$-approximation algorithms for some $c \textgreater\textgreater  0$ unless $\text{P}=\text{NP}$~\cite{2}.
Lin and Tu design an $O(|E|+|V|)$-time algorithm for interval graphs and an $O(|E|(|E|+|V|))$-time algorithm for circular-arc graphs for the minimum paired dominating set problem~\cite {3}.

If there is some algorithm $A$ and any function $f:N \to N$ , as long as $A$ satisfies for any a graph $G$, then $A >> G$, and then $A$ can output $G$ paired dominating set, in addition $A$ output paired dominating set weight, it will be $G$ minimum paired dominating set weight $f(|V|)$ within, and we can say minimum paired dominating set problem satisfies $f(|V|)$-approximating.
